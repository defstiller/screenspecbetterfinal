            characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services.
        </p>
        <p>
            We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information
            does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage
            information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language
            preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our
            Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and

        </p>
        <p>Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.</p>
        <p>The information we collect includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Log and Usage Data.</strong> Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and
                performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we
                record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address,
                device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as
                the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you
                take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports
                (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware settings).

            <li>
                <strong>Device Data.</strong> We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet,

                location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system,
                and system configuration information.

                <strong>Location Data.</strong> We collect location data such as information about your device's location,
                which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings
                of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect
                geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing
                us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location
                setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the
                Services.

Similarly, other users will be able to view descriptions of your activity, communicate with you within our Services, and view your profile.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="section4">4. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third parties that we may link to or who advertise on our Services, but are not affiliated with, our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications and/or contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, services, or applications. Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.
    </p>

    <h2 id="section5">5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</p>
    <p>
        We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.
    </p>

    <h2 id="section6">6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
    </p>

    <h2 id="section7">7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
    </p>

    <h2 id="section8">8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
    </p>
    <h2 id="section9">9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>
    <p>
        We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@enclosurespecialist.com">contact@enclosurespecialist.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="section10">10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>
    <p>
        If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.

    </p>
    <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section <a href="#section14">"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"</a> below.</p>
    <p>
        However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</strong> You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section <a href="#section14">"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"</a> below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Account Information:</strong></p>
    <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services.

    </p>

    <h2 id="section11">11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
    <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
    </p>

    <h2 id="section12">12. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</p>
    <p>
